# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which includes information on different physicochemical attributes of wine, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol levels, among others.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify the quality of wine on a scale of 0 to 10. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate model for prediction.

Steps Involved

Data Collection: The dataset used for this project is publicly available and was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive analysis was performed to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and their impact on wine quality.

Data Preprocessing: Steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features were taken to prepare the data for modeling.

Modeling: Several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, were trained and evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was also performed to optimize the performance of these models.

Evaluation: The models were evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to determine the best-performing model.

Conclusion: The final model chosen based on performance metrics provides a robust prediction of wine quality, and the insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for wine producers and enthusiasts alike.
